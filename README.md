# SubCivic
In 2014 I posted a game called [Liferaft](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=273509438) on Steam Greenlight Concepts and it ranked #43. I built a quick prototype in Stencyl, but the game wasn't really fun. I didn't think that any amount of polish could change that.

I'm currently hoping to capture the same thrill that made Liferaft so popular by developing a top-down exploration adventure. In **SubCivic** you build a submarine, manage your crew, and battle monsters while mining for ore (which you can sell to buy new modules for your sub). It's kind of a mash up between Motherload, Bad Piggies, and FTL.

The mechanics of the game are inspired by a multiplayer mod called Shiprekt.
