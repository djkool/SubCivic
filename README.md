# SubCivic

The [Trello](https://trello.com/b/7kGjEi67/subcivic) page has updated information on current progress.

In **SubCivic** you build a submarine, manage your crew, and battle monsters while mining for ore (which you can sell to buy new modules for your sub). It's kind of a mash up between Motherload, Bad Piggies, and FTL.

The mechanics of the game are inspired by a multiplayer mod called [Shiprekt](https://youtu.be/hmiTzlkERBo?t=29m54s).

## Story

On a distant aquaplanet known simply as Ice V, humanity has located a powerful energy source deep within the frozen core. Competing intergalactic factions rush to colonize and conquer an infinite ocean, spanning across the entire planetâ€™s surface. Little do they know of the titans that lurk in the depths.
