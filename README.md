# SubCivic
In **SubCivic** you build a submarine, manage your crew, and battle monsters while mining for ore (which you can sell to buy new modules for your sub). It's kind of a mash up between Motherload, Bad Piggies, and FTL.

The mechanics of the game are inspired by a multiplayer mod called [Shiprekt](https://youtu.be/hmiTzlkERBo?t=29m54s).
